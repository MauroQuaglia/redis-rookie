Upgrade your Redis database to version 7.4 or above
Upgrade to Redis 7.4 for enhanced security, better resource utilization, and increased stability for your applications.
Redis 7.4 also introduces a slew of new features, including field-level expiration commands for hashes and the ability to start reading a stream from the last entry.
For a quick trial of the features, spin up a free developer database with Redis Cloud that also provides support for the Redis Query Engine, JSON, probabilistic data structures, and Time Series capabilities.
